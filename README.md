# PHI Vault API

A production-grade **Patient Health Information (PHI) management system** built with Ruby on Rails 8. Designed for healthcare environments where data security, auditability, and access control are non-negotiable.

PHI Vault provides a secure REST API for managing patient records, controlling role-based access, and maintaining a full audit trail — with all sensitive fields encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM.

## Architecture Decisions

### JWT with JTI Revocation
Stateless JWT authentication keeps the API horizontally scalable with no session store. Each token carries a unique `jti` (JWT ID) claim stored in Redis. On logout or forced revocation, the JTI is added to a blocklist — giving us the revocability of sessions without the overhead of a session table.

### Active Record Encryption (AES-256-GCM)
PHI fields (`name`, `email`, `diagnosis`, etc.) are encrypted transparently via Rails' built-in `encrypts` macro. Encryption keys are derived from `rails credentials` using `rails db:encryption:init`, meaning plaintext PHI never touches the database. The application queries and decrypts in memory only when needed.

### Pundit for RBAC
Pundit was chosen over CanCanCan for its explicit, per-policy files that map 1:1 with models. In a compliance-sensitive codebase, each policy being a plain Ruby class makes access rules easy to audit and test in isolation.

### Three-Layer Idempotency on Access Requests
`POST /api/v1/access_requests` is protected against duplicate submissions at three levels:
1. **Application check** — query for an existing record with the same `request_id` before inserting
2. **Database unique index** — enforces uniqueness at the DB level regardless of concurrency
3. **`rescue RecordNotUnique`** — handles the race window between steps 1 and 2 gracefully

### Redis Distributed Locking
`ProcessPhiJob` acquires a per-record distributed lock before mutating state. This prevents double-processing when the same job is enqueued multiple times (e.g. after a Sidekiq retry).

### Fail-Open Rate Limiting
The `Middleware::RateLimiter` Rack middleware enforces rate limits via Redis. If Redis becomes unavailable, the middleware **fails open** — requests are passed through rather than blocked. This prioritises availability over strict enforcement during infrastructure incidents.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Ruby 3.x (only needed for local development without Docker)

### 1. Clone and boot

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/phi_vault_api.git
cd phi_vault_api
docker compose up --build
```

This starts Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Sidekiq.

### 2. Set up the database

```bash
docker compose exec web rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
```

The seed file creates sample users for each role. Credentials are printed to the console on first run.

### 3. Get a JWT token

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "admin@example.com", "password": "password"}'
```

Copy the `token` from the response and pass it as a Bearer token on subsequent requests:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/patients \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>"
```

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values before running locally.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string | set by Docker Compose |
| `REDIS_URL` | Redis connection string | `redis://localhost:6379/0` |
| `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` | Decrypts `config/credentials.yml.enc` | required |
| `SECRET_KEY_BASE` | Rails session / cookie signing key | required in production |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Signs JWT tokens | derived from credentials |

> **Never commit `.env` or `config/master.key` to version control.**

---

## API Documentation

Interactive Swagger UI is available at:

```
http://localhost:3000/api-docs
```

The spec is a handwritten OpenAPI 3.0 YAML file (`swagger/v1/swagger.yaml`) with full request/response schemas, authentication flows, and example payloads for all endpoints.

### Key endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/v1/auth/login` | Obtain a JWT token |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/auth/logout` | Revoke the current token |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/patients` | List patients (paginated) |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/patients` | Create a patient |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/patients/:id/medical_records` | List medical records |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/access_requests` | Request PHI access (idempotent) |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/audit_logs` | View audit trail (admin only) |

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run the full suite
bundle exec rspec

# Run a specific file
bundle exec rspec spec/controllers/patients_controller_spec.rb

# Open the coverage report
open coverage/index.html
```

### Current coverage

| Channels | 100.0% |
| Helpers | 100.0% |

## Background Jobs

### `ProcessPhiJob`

Processes PHI records asynchronously via Sidekiq.

```
Queue:    default
Retries:  3 attempts, 5-second wait between attempts
```

**Flow:**
1. Acquires a distributed Redis lock on the record
2. Checks if the record is already `completed` — returns early if so (idempotent)
3. Marks the record as `processing`
4. Performs the PHI processing work
5. Marks the record as `completed`
6. On any error: marks the record as `failed` and re-raises so Sidekiq retries

Monitor jobs via the Sidekiq Web UI at `/sidekiq` (admin access required).

---

## Deployment

The app is deployed to [Fly.io](https://fly.io).

### First-time setup

```bash
fly auth login
fly launch          # creates fly.toml and provisions Postgres + Redis
fly secrets set RAILS_MASTER_KEY=$(cat config/master.key)
fly deploy
```

### Subsequent deploys

```bash
fly deploy
```

### CI/CD

GitHub Actions runs on every push to `main`:

1. Boots services (Postgres, Redis) via Docker Compose
2. Runs `rails db:create db:migrate`
3. Runs `bundle exec rspec`
4. Deploys to Fly.io on green (main branch only)

See `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for the full pipeline.

## Security Notes

| Control | Implementation |
|---|---|
| PHI encryption at rest | `encrypts` macro — AES-256-GCM via Active Record Encryption |
| Token revocation | JTI blocklist in Redis; invalidated on logout |
| Brute-force protection | Rate limiter: 5 requests/min on `/api/v1/auth` |
| General rate limiting | 100 requests/min per user/IP on all other endpoints |
| Access control | Pundit policies enforced on every controller action |
| Audit trail | `AuditLog` records every read and write on PHI |
| PHI filtered from logs | `config.filter_parameters` includes all PHI field names |
| Encrypted credentials | `rails credentials` — never stored in plain text |

## Contributing

1. Branch from `main`: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
2. Write tests first — PRs without specs will not be merged
3. Ensure `bundle exec rspec` passes with no failures
4. Open a pull request with a clear description of the change
